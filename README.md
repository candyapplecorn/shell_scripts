# Shell scripts for assessments

The goal of these scripts is to reduce the amount of command line usage for beginners. They end in _.command_ so that they may be clicked from the Apple GUI, making these otherwise command-line only operations more accessible.

  - __mocha.command__ runs mocha and displays troubleshooting information.
  - __zip.command__ prompts the user and creates a properly named archive file.

## Usage

__Mac__: Simply double-click to run!<br>
__Linux__: From terminal: `$bash zip.command` or `$bash mocha.command`.

__Windows__: _No support yet_, unless you're using Windows 10, which _may_ have bash installed; _probably only if you remember installing it!_ If bash is installed, see instructions for Linux.

## Install

These scripts _must be in the same folder_ which contains '_assessment.js_'.<br>
The "hard" part is actually getting these command files:

#### The easiest way:
1. __Download__ '<i>bundled_commands.zip</i>'
2. __Copy__ '<i>bundled_commands.zip</i>' to the desired folder.
3. __Extract__ it.

The other is to clone or download this repository and copy the desired command files to the folder containing '_assessment.js_':
1. Click the green button labeled '__Clone or Download__'.
2. Select '__Download Zip__'.
3. __Unzip__ the archive.
4. __Copy the command file(s)__ to the desired folder(s).

2. todo: Permissions??.
3. Make this all __cross-platform__ (Windows) by abandoning bash - batfile?
